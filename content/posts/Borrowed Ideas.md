Most of the thoughts I respect didn’t start in my head. They came from somewhere older, slower, and quieter: books.

Books don’t shout. They don’t demand instant reaction. They sit, patient, until you’re ready to think with them. They shift how you look at work, time, ambition, fear, love, meaning. Sometimes gently. Sometimes violently.

When I read something, I underline. I argue with it. I agree reluctantly. I disagree loudly. I let it sit for a while. And then I come here to see what survived.

You’ll find:
- ideas worth stealing  
- ideas worth resisting  
- ideas that bruise your ego a little  
- and occasionally, ideas that make life simpler

None of this is original in the heroic sense. It’s borrowed, but lived with.

If something here makes you pause for half a second before scrolling to whatever comes next, it did its job.

Let’s see where this goes.
