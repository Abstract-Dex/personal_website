## Welcome to Borrowed Ideas

Hey, I'm **Rajdeep**, an AI engineer by day, avid reader by night (and weekends, and lunch breaks...).

While I spend my working hours building with AI and tech, books are where I find the ideas that actually shape how I think. This blog is my way of passing along the wisdom, insights, and lessons I've gathered from reading across different genres.

### Why "Borrowed Ideas"?

Every great idea builds on something that came before. The thoughts I share here aren't entirely my own, they're borrowed from brilliant authors, thinkers, and storytellers. My job is simply to distill them into something useful for you.

### What You'll Find Here

- **Fiction takeaways** — Life lessons hidden in stories
- **Self-help insights** — Practical wisdom you can actually use
- **Philosophy reflections** — Big questions, simplified
- **Non-fiction summaries** — Key ideas from books worth reading

### The Goal

I read so you don't have to read everything. But hopefully, my notes will inspire you to pick up a book or two yourself.
